Go to the front end and open a live server

In the buttom of the page you find the "create form". Fill it out and press "create" to add a new artist.
Below each aritst you find 3 buttons: 
Delete - for imidate deletion of the artist object.
Update - That fills the artist information in the update form "found by scrolling to the buttom of the page".
Favorite - that marks the aritst a favorite or not.

To see only your favorite aritst press the "show favorites button".
The filter drop down allows the user to filter by genre. 
The sort function work based on 4 different input types. 

Do note that the filter functions does not work for newly created aritsts, as the genres (and lables) input adds a string and not an array. This 
also applies to aritsts with updated genres...

Do enjoy the timeless design of the page.
